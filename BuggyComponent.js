This React component has a subtle bug related to how it handles asynchronous operations and updates to its state. The `fetchData` function fetches data from an API and then updates the `data` state.  The problem arises if the component unmounts before the asynchronous `fetchData` call completes.  This can lead to a warning in the console like "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component" and potentially unexpected behavior.  The component also fails to handle errors during the API call, leaving the UI unresponsive in error scenarios.
